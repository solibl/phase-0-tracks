Personal Robot Elevator:

Get information from user to figure out what floor you want to go to:
	-Input the floor into a variable.

Define a max floor, number of columns, number of rows.
row = 0
column = 1
counter = 1
until counter == userinput
	if counter is userinput 
		press the floor button
	else if column = 3
	row = row +1
	column = 1
	else
	column = column + 1
end

This will allow the robot to start from the 1st floor on the button list to gothrough the floors until the one you
want is picked.

Eating (My Algorithm)

If I am feeling hungry:
	-Until time is equal to 12:00 pm, 3:00 pm, 6:00 pm, 9:00 pm:
		-Go to Fridge:
			If food is not there:
			-Go to fast food.
			Anything else grab the food.
		-Figure out if it needs to be cooked or microwaved:
			-use Microwave if needed.
			-use stove if needed.
		-Eat food
	-If time is not at 12:00 pm, 3:00 pm, 6:00 pm, 9:00 pm:
		-Wait until time is equal to the above.
