# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way to make sure that any changes to the main code is checked before adding it to the main code. It is useful so that if the code that someone enters is incorrect, it will have a save point that can be rolled back to a specific version. It is useful because it can help manage files and other information when multiple people are working on the project. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a version of code / files taken from the master branch in order to make any changes from the master code / files. A person would use a branch to write code / files in order to test any features they would like to push. Another reason why someone would use a branch is if multiple people are working on an assignment, they can create their own branch if they are working on different features. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is adding the change / modified file to the repository. It adds a save point to the .git folder. You can fall back on these save points in case something you modified wasn't really working. A good commit message explains what you changed from the existing files or what you added.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when a line in a file has two different changes. An example would be when two people working on the same project change the same line but both had different changes. If the line has 2 different changes, there will be a conflict when they are merged together.
