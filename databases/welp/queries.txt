2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

COMMAND
sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;

OUTPUT
1|1|Worst Wedding Ever|1|1|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|1|Bradford|Pitt
2|4|Cheap and Fast|2|3|2|Amir's Towing|3|Angela|Jolie
3|3|Fun club but no dogs|3|2|3|The Beagle Nightclub|2|Mandy|Kaling
4|2|Unclean|4|4|4|Lotus Yoga|4|Steven|Wonder
5|3|Plumber didn't know how to plumb|5|5|5|Plumbing by Janet|5|Holly|Berry

3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

COMMAND
SELECT reviews.stars, reviews.comment, businesses.name, users.firstname, users.lastname FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;

OUTPUT
1|Worst Wedding Ever|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Bradford|Pitt
4|Cheap and Fast|Amir's Towing|Angela|Jolie
3|Fun club but no dogs|The Beagle Nightclub|Mandy|Kaling
2|Unclean|Lotus Yoga|Steven|Wonder
3|Plumber didn't know how to plumb|Plumbing by Janet|Holly|Berry

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

COMMAND
sqlite> SELECT reviews.stars, reviews.comment, businesses.name, users.firstname, users.lastname FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id WHERE businesses.name="Lotus Yoga"; 

OUTPUT
