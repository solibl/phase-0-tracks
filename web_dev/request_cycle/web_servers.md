In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
It is a remote virtual computer run by an internet hosting service.
The advantages of using a VPS is that you don't have to use your own computer when making and accessing ports.
It is less expensive than having a full dedicated hosting plan that uses a physical server.
It is also a good learning tool that you can mess around it. 

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
Security: It has been mentioned already quite a few times in this question but basically it's the same thing, harder to hack if you dont know the admin user's login account. root means you already have one half of the working set of admin credentials.
