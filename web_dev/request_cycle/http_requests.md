Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
An HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie or simply cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's web browser while the user is browsing.
Cookies are mainly used for these three purposes:
Session management (user logins, shopping carts)
Personalization (user preferences)
Tracking (analyzing user behavior)
